# AI-Artistry: Creativity in the Age of Artificial Intelligence
**Final Project for MSc in Artificial Intelligence**

Welcome to the repository for *AI-Artistry: Creativity in the Age of Artificial Intelligence*, my final MSc project in Artificial Intelligence. This project explores the intersection of art and technology, demonstrating how AI models can be leveraged to create unique artistic outputs, including poetry and music generation.

## Project Overview
In this project, I have worked on AI models that generate new poetry and music. My approach was to  

## Key Features
- **Music Generation**: Custom LSTM, Transformer, and GRU models trained on classical music datasets to generate melodies, exploring the role of AI in music composition.
- **Poetry Generation**: Fine-tuned GPT-2 models that produce poetry based on various themes and styles, compared with the base GPT-2 model to evaluate the impact of fine-tuning.
- **Poetry Generation**: Combining music and the generated poetry utilizing a TTS model to create a final output. 
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Tailor-made metrics to assess the quality of the generated outputs, focusing on both technical aspects (e.g., readability, sentiment) and domain-specific nuances (e.g., rhyme density, lyrical complexity).

## Goals
The project not only aims to produce compelling AI-generated art but also critically examines the relationship between AI and human creativity. Through the development of  models and custom evaluation criteria, this work seeks to understand the capabilities and limitations of AI in emulating human-like creative processes.
